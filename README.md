This is the repository for the paper "Rapid, physics-based ground motion time series using reduced-order modeling of 3D seismic wave propagation simulations", by John M. Rekoske, Alice-Agnes Gabriel & Dave A. May submitted to Geophysical Journal International."

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `seismogram_rom_demo.ipynb`, demonstrating the method used in the paper to generate rapid seismograms using a reduced-order model. The velocity seismograms for the sixteen receivers labeled in the paper are provided here as a numpy binary file, `seismos_16_receivers.npy`.
